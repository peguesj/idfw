# DOC ID: IDFPJs
**Version**: Various  
**Date**: 2025-01-01

## 1. Introduction

**IDFPJs** stands for **Idea Definition Framework Project Journeys**. They are **predefined sets** of recommended documents, diagrams, and (optionally) axis constraints that streamline development for **typical project types**. Each IDFPJ can be customized by adding, removing, or adjusting any of the recommended artifacts.

## 2. Documentation for IDFPJ

Detailed documentation specific to the IDFPJ object, including definitions, usage guidelines, and integration points.

### Purpose

1. **Accelerate** setup by providing out-of-the-box best practices.  
2. **Standardize** documentation, diagram usage, and iteration flows for known project types (SaaS MVP, IoT, etc.).  
3. **Demonstrate** how IDFW (Idea Definition Framework) can adapt to varying complexities, from minimal prototypes to enterprise-scale architectures.

### Format & Structure

Each IDFPJ typically includes:
- A **title** and **description** to clarify the core project context.  
- A **keyComponents** list referencing relevant documents (BRD, FRS, TAD, etc.) and diagrams (SCTX, ERD, CMP, etc.).  
- `axisCoordinates` if the project type usually sets default values for multi-axis analysis (e.g., security vs. complexity).  
- **useCases** illustrating typical real-world scenarios.

## 3. Basic SaaS MVP

### Description
A streamlined path to validating a **Software-as-a-Service** concept quickly, with minimal overhead. Emphasis on:
- A few essential docs (BRD for business context, FRS for features, TAD for a simple architecture).
- Light security/compliance (SCD) if needed.  
- Governance doc (GOV) to handle versioning and releases.

### Key Components
- **BRD** (defines high-level objectives and market potential).  
- **FRS** (lists core MVP features).  
- **TAD** (basic architecture: front end, back end, and database).  
- **SCD** (optional or minimal for early stages).  
- **GOV** (tracking version control, doc updates).

### Use Cases
- Quick prototypes for new SaaS ideas.
- Startups needing a small set of docs for investor pitches or initial user trials.

### Example Axis Coordinates (optional)
```json
{
“TimeToMarket”: 8,
“Security”: 3
}
```
Reflecting high priority on speed, moderate or low security.

## 4. IoT-Enabled Service

### Description
Focus on solutions that integrate **hardware devices** or sensors, real-time data ingestion, and device management. Security is typically more important due to potential firmware vulnerabilities.

### Key Components
- **BRD** (business model for hardware integration or subscription-based IoT).  
- **FRS** (detailed functional flows for device registration, sensor data).  
- **TAD** (describes IoT gateways, data pipelines, real-time analytics).  
- **API** (managing device endpoints, sensor data ingestion).  
- **SCD** (stronger security focus, potentially device firmware update policies).  
- **BCD** (business continuity for devices and services).  
- **GOV** (version control, doc lifecycle).

### Use Cases
- Smart home solutions, industrial IoT deployments, wearable tech with cloud analytics.

### Example Axis Coordinates (optional)
```json
{
“Security”: 9,
“AnalyticsComplexity”: 7
}
```
High security, moderate analytics complexity.

## 5. Enterprise Multi-Tenant

### Description
Designed for **enterprise-scale SaaS** with complex **RBAC** (role-based access control), multi-region deployment, strict compliance (SOC 2, GDPR), and high availability.

### Key Components
- **BRD** (large-scale business justification, competitor analysis).  
- **FRS** (advanced features, multi-tenant user roles).  
- **TAD** (microservices, data partitioning, multi-region replication).  
- **API** (user management, tenant provisioning).  
- **SCD** (GDPR compliance, encryption, logging).  
- **BCD** (disaster recovery across regions).  
- **GOV** (versioning, devops, release management).  
- **HPLOT** if analyzing trade-offs among compliance, performance, cost.

### Use Cases
- Enterprise software vendors building multi-tenant solutions.  
- Heavily regulated industries with data protection laws.

### Example Axis Coordinates (optional)
```json
{
“Compliance”: 10,
“Scalability”: 9,
“Performance”: 8
}
```

## 6. Mobile-First eCommerce

### Description
Centers on a **highly optimized mobile** user experience for shopping, in-app purchases, and push notifications. Involves a robust checkout flow with multi-currency support.

### Key Components
- **BRD** (market strategy, user demographics).  
- **FRS** (cart, checkout, shipping, notifications).  
- **TAD** (mobile-friendly architecture, possibly serverless or hybrid).  
- **API** (payment integration, product listings).  
- **SCD** (PCI-DSS compliance or equivalent, data protection).  
- **BCD** (handling traffic spikes or payment failures).  
- **GOV** (release cycles, version control).  
- **UXD** (extensive mobile design prototypes).

### Use Cases
- Retail apps, subscription box platforms, multi-platform commerce solutions.

### Example Axis Coordinates (optional)
```json
{
“UXPriority”: 9,
“PaymentComplexity”: 7
}
```

## 7. Big Data & Analytics

### Description
Addresses data ingestion pipelines, large data lakes or warehouses, advanced dashboards, potentially **ML** or data science modules.

### Key Components
- **BRD** (analytics use case, ROI for big data).  
- **FRS** (data ingestion features, ETL flows).  
- **TAD** (data lake vs. data warehouse, streaming systems like Kafka).  
- **API** (stats/analytics endpoints).  
- **SCD** (privacy for user data, large-scale compliance).  
- **BCD** (backup, multi-region DR, big data cluster failover).  
- **GOV** (versioning for data pipeline changes).  
- **HPLOT** if analyzing cost vs. throughput vs. data complexity.

### Use Cases
- Marketing analytics, IoT data processing, enterprise BI solutions.

### Example Axis Coordinates (optional)
```json

## 8. Custom Innovation / R&D

### Description
A flexible approach for open-ended **research** or advanced **prototypes** that may not follow standard docs or iteration flows. Possibly skipping many typical docs to allow for rapid exploration.

- Potentially minimal or choose a la carte from BRD, FRS, TAD, etc.  
- SCD or BCD only if relevant.  
- May use advanced or domain-specific diagrams.

### Use Cases
- Innovation labs, AI/ML experiments, HPC prototypes.  
- Projects that need maximum creativity, minimal formal overhead.

```json
{
“Experimentation”: 10,

## 9. Resume Enhancer MVP (Optional Example)

*(In some references, the Resume Enhancer MVP is included as a separate IDFPJ. You may or may not keep it in your set.)*

### Description
Targets quick build of a resume enhancement platform that leverages LLM integration to update a user’s resume content. Possibly includes a minimal front end (3 columns: tabs, input, preview).

### Key Components
- **BRD** (value proposition: easy resume updates for targeted roles).  
- **FRS** (enhancement logic, LLM calls, user fields).  
- **TAD** (UI layout, LLM calls, data storage).  
- **API** for asynchronous calls to the LLM or NLP.

- Possibly **SCD** if storing personal data in logs or cloud.

### Example Axis Coordinates

```json
{
“LLMComplexity”: 6,
“UIClarity”: 8
}
```

## 10. Usage & Customization

### Selecting or Merging Journeys
Projects can combine multiple journeys if needed. For example, an **IoT** system plus **Big Data** analytics expansions might unify the recommended doc sets.

### Overriding or Extending
Each IDFPJ’s recommended docs and diagrams are purely **defaults**:
- Add or remove doc/diagram references
- Tweak axisCoordinates for your risk/complexity profile
- Integrate with domain-specific schemas (e.g., `resume.schema.json`)
